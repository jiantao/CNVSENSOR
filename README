bam_loader
----------

  This submodule is used to calculate the read coverage across multiple samples and targets
regions. The output, which is a binary file representing the data aformentioned, will
serve as the input of CNV SENSOR for down-stream calculation to detect
structure variation. The usage can be found by executing the program
'bam_loader'. Basically this program takes in a bed file and a bunch of bam
files to generate the binary file containing the coverage data.
